## Description

![alt text](https://github.com/caneryilmaz52/TravellingDealer/blob/master/app/src/main/res/drawable/problem.jpeg)

As you may notice, image represents the customers (8 units) and a factory. Dealer should travel to his/her customers by using the shortest path. The dealer must visit the factory aer every customer visitation.

We need to calculate the total distance that dealer need to travel in order to visit each customer.

You should implement your own data structure(LinkedList). You can implement it either in Kotlin or Java.

Store each shortest path in your own Node. Then, by implementing the “sumOfNodes” method you could solve the problem. At the end clean all nodes by implementing “deleteNode” method.
